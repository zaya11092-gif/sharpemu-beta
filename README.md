## Info

SharpEmu is an emulator project currently in its early stages of development.

This project is developed purely for research and educational purposes. There are no commercial goals associated with it. We enjoy learning about system architecture and reverse engineering.

SharpEmu focuses exclusively on the PlayStation 5.  
Our goal is **not** to emulate PS4 games, as there is already an excellent emulator dedicated to that platform: **ShadPS4**.

## Status

The emulator can currently load the `eboot.bin` of real games, execute native CPU instructions, and partially handle kernel-related functionality. However, several critical components are still missing.

Current capabilities include:

* Loading `eboot.bin` and `.elf` files
* Executing native CPU instructions
* Reading basic game metadata (title, version, etc.)
* Loading system modules (`prx` / `sys_module`)
* Partial support for some kernel functions  
* `Fiber` and `AMPR` exports
* PlayGo scenarios
* Initial loading game files
* Shader/resource submits and AGC initial
* Video outputs in some games

Some games have reached like `sceVideoOut` and AGC stages.

SharpEmu supports Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts. Video output uses Vulkan on
Windows and Linux, and MoltenVK on macOS. Platform support is still experimental,
so compatibility and performance vary by game, operating system, and GPU driver.

## Using

Download the release archive for your operating system, extract it, and launch
SharpEmu with the path to a legally obtained game's `eboot.bin`.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\SharpEmu.exe "C:\path\to\game\eboot.bin" 2>&1 |
  Tee-Object -FilePath "SharpEmu.log"
```

Linux and macOS:

```bash
chmod +x ./SharpEmu

./SharpEmu "/path/to/game/eboot.bin" 2>&1 |
  tee SharpEmu.log
```

A Vulkan-capable GPU and current graphics driver are required. The macOS
release includes the MoltenVK Vulkan implementation.

## Games Tested

* **Demon's Souls Remake**
  * [Demon's Souls [PPSA01341]](https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu/issues/2)
  * Demon's Souls is now video loop. Shaders are ready to be converted to SPIR-V/Vulkan. We are continuing our work on this.

* **Poppy Playtime Chapter 1**
  * [Poppy Playtime Chapter 1 [PPSA20591]](https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu/issues/3)

* **SILENT HILL: The Short Message**
  * [SILENT HILL: The Short Message [PPSA10112]](https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu/issues/4)

* **Dreaming Sarah**

  * Real texture rendering for this game;

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project does **not** support or condone piracy.  
> All games used during development and testing are dumped from consoles that we personally own.  
> Users are expected to use legally obtained copies of their games.

## Build

1. Install the .NET SDK version specified in [`global.json`](./global.json).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sharpemu/sharpemu.git`
3. Open the solution file (`SharpEmu.slnx`) in **VSCode**.
4. Build the project: `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`
5. Build artifacts will be located in the `artifacts` directory.

## Special Thanks

The following projects were extremely helpful during development:

* **[ShadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4)**  
Helped with understanding the basic architecture of the PlayStation 4.

* **[Kyty](https://github.com/InoriRus/Kyty)**  
One of the few PS5 emulator projects available and very useful for studying native code execution.

* **Ryujinx**  
Provided valuable references for filesystem handling and low-level C# implementation patterns.
